:cube:Hah hah...splendid.
:cube:You're such an interesting being.
:minesweeper:Really?
:cube:Yes...
:cube:But our time together has only just begun.
:cube:In fact, let's have you meet with the others.
:minesweeper:Others?
:cube:Why don't I introduce you all?
::*snap*
::...
:minesweeper:Eh...?
:bf:Be bop pa!
:skid:Hello there!
:pump:Hello Robot guy!
:mom:Is your head a computer?
:cat:Meow!
:pico:You look like a robot without limbs.
:anders:What dimension did you come from?
:dad:Do I know you?
:senpai:Are you also from a game?
:salesman:I don't sell Windows, but I do sell doors!
:atlanta:*Surfs* up!
:cube:Hmmm...
:cube:Seeing you all in one place, I've changed my mind.
:cube:How about a little wager?
:cube:Two of you will challenge me, and if you win, I'll let you all leave.
:pump:And if we don't win?
:cube:You'll be stuck here forever.
:cube:...Oh, I almost forgot.
:cube:You'll be facing me in my final form too.
*flash*
:round:No longer am I Untextured Default Blender Cube.
:round:I am now Slightly Textured Rounded Blender Cube.
:round:How about it? Who's up for the task?
:minesweeper:I'll go.
:round:Very nice!
:round:Now then, who else wants to challenge me?
