:dad:I think we're done here.
:dad:Unlike you, I'm quite busy, and I've got business to take care of back in my dimension.
:cube:Don't be like that. We've only just begun.
:cube:There are so many others I want to hear you sing with.
:cube:In fact, why don't I let you all meet each other?
::*snap*
::...
:dad:...!
:bf:Beep?
:skid:Hello, purple man!
:pump:Is that your trick-or-treating costume?
:salesman:I need to get out of here.
:mom:I had a feeling you'd be here too, Dearie.
:minesweeper:Greetings, Sir!
:pico:Did you get more purple since the last time we met?
:anders:What a strange sight.
:senpai:...You!
:cat:Mew!
:atlanta:Oh my *cod*! Are you that ex-rockstar?
:cube:Hmmm...
:cube:Seeing you all in one place, I've changed my mind.
:cube:How about a little wager?
:cube:Two of you will challenge me, and you win, I'll let you all leave.
:mom:And what happens if we don't win?
:cube:You'll be stuck here forever.
:cube:...Oh, I almost forgot.
:cube:You'll be facing me in my final form too.
::*flash*
:round:No longer am I Untextured Default Blender Cube.
:round:I am now Slightly Textured Rounded Blender Cube.
:round:How about it? Who's up for the task?
:dad:Fine, I'll play by your rules.
:round:Very nice!
:round:Now then, who else wants to challenge me?
