:skid:That was fun, but where is the exit?
:pump:We're going to miss our trick-or-treating if we stay here too long.
:cube:Leave the sugar for later.
:cube:There are so many more people I want you to sing with.
:cube:Let's have them all gather here, why don't we?
::*snap*
::...
:dad:Okay, who is it this time?
:mom:Welcome to the party, kids.
:cat:Mew.
:bf:Skadoop!
:anders:And you even got kids involved in this?
:pico:Are those costumes?
:senpai:Why are you two standing on top of one another?
:salesman:Can I interest you in a door? It may be more useful than you think.
:atlanta:Hey there little *minnows*!
:minesweeper:I think I saw you both somewhere else...
:cube:Hmmm...
:cube:Seeing you all in one place, I've changed my mind.
:cube:How about a little wager?
:cube:Two of you will challenge me, and if you win, I'll let you all leave.
:senpai:And what happens if we fail?
:cube:You'll be stuck here forever.
:cube:...Oh, I almost forgot.
:cube:You'll be facing me in my final form too.
::*flash*
:round:No longer am I Untextured Default Blender Cube.
:round:I am now Slightly Textured Rounded Blender Cube.
:round:How about it? Who's up for the task?
:spooky:Oh, us!
:round:Very nice!
:round:Hmm, since you two operate as one, I'll let one more person join.
:round:Now then, who else wants to challenge me?
