:senpai:I think I'd really like to go home now.
:cube:Why not stay here for a little longer? Perhaps even a lot longer...
:senpai:Okay, you're officially creeping me out.
:senpai:Hello? Is there anyone else in here? I need some help!
:cube:Oh, you want to see other people?
:cube:Don't worry. I've brought over tons of other people like you!
::*snap*

:skid:Hello, stranger! Why are you so squarey?
:pump:You look like a video game!
:minesweeper:Hello Retro Guy.
:bf:Skeet baloop!
:atlanta:Are you from one of those animes?
:mom:Hmm, who is this odd-looking man?
:dad:You again!
:cat:Nyaa!
:pico:I have no idea who you are.
:anders:You look strange. Where did you come from?
:salesman:Hey, I think I have just the door for you.
:cube:Hmmm...
:cube:Seeing you all in one place, I've changed my mind.
:cube:How about a little wager?
:cube:Two of you will challenge me, and if you win, I'll let you all leave.
:pico:And if we lose...?
:cube:You'll be stuck here forever.
:cube:...Oh, I almost forgot.
:cube:You'll be facing me in my final form too.
::*flash*
:round:No longer am I Untextured Default Blender Cube.
:round:I am now Slightly Textured Rounded Blender Cube.
:round:How about it? Who's up for the task?
:senpai:If it means getting out of here, I'll do it.
:round:Very nice!
:round:Now then, who else wants to challenge me?
