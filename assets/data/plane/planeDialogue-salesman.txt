:cube:Hello, salesman.
:salesman:Good day, sentient construct! May I interest you in a door?
:cube:I'm sorry to say, but I'm not interested.
:salesman:Strange. Usually that wins people over.
:salesman:If you haven't called me for a door, why am I here?
:cube:Let's just say I've taken an interest in your skills of persuasion.
:cube:I also know that you possess an autotuner. Shall we test it?
:salesman:Will you consider browsing my wares if I accept?
:cube:I'll consider it...
:salesman:Allow me to show you what I have to offer.
