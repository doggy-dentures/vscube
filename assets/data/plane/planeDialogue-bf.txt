:cube:Hello there, little one.
:bf:Blip bloop.
:cube:Please, take a seat.
:cube:Oh wait, there are no seats here.
:cube:It seems you'll have to remain standing.
:bf:Beep bap.
:cube:You caused quite the havoc during that bout with ol' Suzanne a while ago, you know.
:cube:Took that monkey a whole weekend to clean up the mess you made.
:bf:Bup boop?
:cube:I took a keen interest in you after that affair.
:cube:So, I've brought you here to test you.
:cube:Say pal, are you up for a song?
:bf:Bleep!
:cube:Good, good.
:cube:I won't be testing you on just your singing though.
:cube:Let's see how confident you are in your marksmanship.
