:cube:Hello there, Daddy Dearest.
:dad:Do I know you?
:cube:You don't, of course. But I know you.
:cube:I've taken a very special interest in you and your singing.
:cube:So much so that I wanted to see your own ability for myself.
:cube:So, how about a song between the two of us?
:dad:Hmph, alright then. I'll humor you.
:cube:Good, good. Let's add a little something extra to sweeten the deal as well.
