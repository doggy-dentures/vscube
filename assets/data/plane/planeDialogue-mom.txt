:cube:Ah, it's about time you arrived.
:mom:Quite bold of you to drag me here.
:mom:Let's hope you won't regret it.
:cube:No need for that kind of attitude.
:cube:I've brought you here under friendly terms.
:cube:You see, I'm quite a fan of your singing talent.
:mom:An admirer, huh.
:cube:So, how about a small singing bout between the two of us?
:mom:Alright then, I'll entertain you.
:cube:The rules will stray a bit from the usual singing battle though.
:mom:Bring it on. I can take it.
