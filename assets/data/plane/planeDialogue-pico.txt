:cube:Hello there, Pico.
:pico:Who are you?
:cube:Don't be alarmed.
:cube:I brought you here out of interest, nothing more.
:pico:Is there something you want from me?
:cube:I'd just like to hear how well you do in a music bout.
:pico:Ugh, not again. Singing really isn't my thing.
:cube:Don't worry. This involves your gunmanship as well.
